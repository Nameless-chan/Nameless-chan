# Zerotistic - about me
I am an 20 year old vulnerability researcher & reverse engineer who loves computer security. I do CTFs weekly and have been part of the Belgium team at ECSC in 2022 and 2023. I main pwn and reverse engineering, but I also do some web, can grep forensics flags and guess the crypto. <br>
I am a CTF player for [idek](https://www.idek.team/) & [Friendly Maltese Citizens](https://ctf.mt/) (with whom I'll be playing as a finalist for DEFCON 2024) <br>

My interesting projects are private !
<br><br>

I have a blog [zerotistic.blog](https://zerotistic.blog/) ! 
I write some stuff about maths and infosec on [phasetw0](https://phasetw0.com) website; such as [this article about complex number](https://phasetw0.com/maths/complex-number/), or [this one on AV/EDR bypass](https://phasetw0.com/malware/edr-bypass/).
